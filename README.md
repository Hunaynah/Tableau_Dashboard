I’ve created an interactive Tableau dashboard to highlight key economic and housing trends in Texas from 2000 to 2015. The goal is to make complex data easy to understand for everyday Texans who are affected by things like rising home prices, cost of living, and job market changes.

I’ve used the TXHousing dataset along with additional government data to explore how population growth, gas prices, and political leadership impacted everything from GDP to crime rates.

The dashboard includes filters, KPIs, and clear visuals to let users explore trends over time and make their own informed conclusions. It’s a tool that turns data into a story—designed for the general public to better understand what’s really happening around them.
